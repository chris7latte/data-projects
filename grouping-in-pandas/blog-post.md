# Grouping in Pandas

### Summary
Grouping can be a powerful tool for any data analyst to leverage while trying to get the most out of a dataset.

### Codes and stuff

First, I’ll just state that I’m running pandas 0.18.1, just so we're on the same page.

```
>>> import pandas
>>> pandas.__version__
u’0.18.1'
```
